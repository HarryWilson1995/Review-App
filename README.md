# Language Course Review Site - LingoRater

This application provides a platform on which users can write language course reviews and browse reviews written by other users. A user can only edit and delete a review if it has been written by himself/herself. Users can see lists of all authors/publishers, languages and course titles which have been created. In addition to this a user can search for a specific course, author/publisher or language in order to speed up their search. Users can then view a specific course and all its reviews, as well as add their own.

A user can fill out the main course review form to add a review for a course which does not yet exist on the site. A user can only edit/delete their reviews. They cannot edit/delete a course as I wish for courses to remain on the site so that other users can benefit from any additional reviews which have been written. This way the site will be populated with a large number of reviews. Similarly, users cannot delete/edit languages or authors/publishers.
